                    In my final semester in university, I was handed the opportunity to participate in a CTF as one part of a continuous assessment under my software security module.

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
                    The CTF included multiple types of challenges, ranging from simple steganography challenges and SQL-injections to more complicated OSINT and overflow-based tasks.

                    Overall, my team, 'sanitycheck', managed to attain the <strong>fastest 25% of submissions with all challenges completed</strong>, and obtaining an <strong>A+</strong> in the post-CTF write-up.

                    Overall, I felt that me and my team did a stellar job despite us being first-timers in CTF challenges. The countless practices and hack-the-boxes certainly paid off for the actual CTF, and I am hugely appreciative of my members for our success.

                    The importance of teamwork shouldn't be understated - we couldn't have done it without each other. I have also learnt that it's always good to be inquisitive, and to constantly ask questions, in which then one will improve themselves further.
