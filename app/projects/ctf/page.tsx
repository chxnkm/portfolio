                            In my final semester in university, I was handed the opportunity to participate in a CTF as one part of a continuous assessment under my software security module.
                            <br /><br />
                            The CTF included multiple types of challenges, ranging from simple steganography challenges and SQL-injections to more complicated OSINT and overflow-based tasks.
                            <br /><br />
                            Overall, my team, &apos;sanitycheck&apos;, managed to attain the <strong>fastest 25% of submissions with all challenges completed</strong>, and obtaining an <strong>A+</strong> in the post-CTF write-up. Our report can be viewed <Link href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mSA6R24XB0T6NnGSDTNbPv5IG0WEnMUkfOjE8nq7HeQ/edit?usp=sharing' className="underline text-blue-500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" prefetch={false}>here</Link>.

                        Overall, I felt that me and my team did a stellar job despite us being first-timers in CTF challenges. The countless practices and hack-the-boxes certainly paid off for the actual CTF, and I am hugely appreciative of my members for our success.
                        <br /><br />
                        The importance of teamwork shouldn&apos;t be understated - we couldn&apos;t have done it without each other. I have also learnt that it&apos;s always good to be inquisitive, and to constantly ask questions, in which then one will improve themselves further.
