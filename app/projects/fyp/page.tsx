                            For my final year in university, I delved into crowd estimation as my topic for my final-year project. Under the tutelage and guidance of my professor Cham Tat Jen, I successfully utilised and improved the <strong>Point-Query Transformer (PET)</strong> crowd counting method, and evaluated it on a <strong>local novel Singaporean crowd dataset</strong> created for this project; some of the photos from the dataset are shown on the left.<br/><br/>

                            The PET crowd counting method is a transformer-based crowd estimation technique. To summise, it involves a standard encoder-decoder transformer, modified with a variable rectangle window to deal with queried points of different densities. The densities of each queried point in a crowd image is determined using the <strong>point-query quadtree</strong>, which splits dense points into 4 smaller points for processing. The eventual predictions will then be crafted with the points queried and processed.<br/><br/>
                            The architecture of the PET model is shown on the left.

                            The journey of the final-year project was not an easy one - countless sleepless nights were spent toiling over training data, hyperparameter tuning, and writing and structuring ideas into a full-fledged report. Time management and efficiency were crucial in carrying the project over the line.<br/><br/>
                            If I were to change anything in my project, it will be to give more time to my dataset creation and curation, which I felt was slightly lacking. However, I felt that the final-year project was overall well done, with an emphasis on <strong>clarity and solution-finding</strong>.
